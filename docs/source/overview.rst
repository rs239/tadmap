Overview
========


Topologically associating domains (TADs) are contiguous segments of the genome where the genomic elements are in frequent contact with each other. Genes that cooccupy a TAD are often functionally related and more likely to be coexpressed than random gene pairs, The TAD Map (`bioRxiv (2021)`_) provides a consensus estimate, aggregated from multiple experimental datasets, of this layout in human and mouse. It also provides tools to map any single-cell RNA-seq dataset to *TAD signatures*, where gene expression is mapped to TAD activation probabilities in each cell.
